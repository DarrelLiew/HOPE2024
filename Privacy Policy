Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 10/11/2024

Thank you for choosing our community prayer app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data is secure. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information about you when you use our app.

1. Information We Collect
Our app is designed to support community prayer and requires minimal information from users. The only information we collect is:

User ID and Password: To access the app, you will receive a user ID and password issued by our community administrators. There is no option to create or delete accounts within the app itself.
Prayer Submissions: Prayers submitted through the app are anonymous. We do not collect any identifying information alongside prayers, and no personal data is required or requested with prayer submissions.
2. How We Use Your Information
Access Control: The user ID and password are used solely to verify that users are part of our community and have authorized access to the app. This is essential to ensure that only community members can participate in the prayer activities within the app.
Prayer Submissions: Prayer submissions are anonymous and are only used within the app to allow community members to share their prayers and requests.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your data with any third parties. Access to the app and its data is restricted to our community, and no information is made public or accessible outside the app.
Since prayer submissions are anonymous, there is no identifying information attached to them that could be shared or disclosed.
4. Data Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your user ID, password, and prayer submissions. Access to the app is limited to users within our community, and we employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

5. Your Rights
Access: If you have any questions about the data we hold related to your user ID, please contact the app administrator within your community.
No Collection of Personal Information: Because we do not collect or store any additional personal data through the app, there are no additional user rights associated with data management, such as deletion or correction of personal data.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If there are significant changes, we will notify users within the app or via community announcements.

7. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us through our communityâ€™s administrative team
